    "<b>Abstract:</b> \n",
    "This project aimed to simulate the magnetic lens component of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), crucial for focusing an electron beam to achieve high-resolution imaging. Utilizing computational methods, we developed a simulation model to study the magnetic field's behavior within the lens and its impact on electron trajectories. The project involved deriving the expressions for radial and longitudinal magnetic field components in cylindrical coordinates, implementing these equations to simulate the lens's focusing action, and analyzing the effects of varying the lens parameters. Our findings underscore the significance of the magnetic lens in SEM operation, demonstrating how its geometry and magnetic field strength dictate the beam's focus and resolution. This simulation offers valuable insights into the design and optimization of magnetic lenses in SEMs and potentially other electron-beam instruments, contributing to the advancement of microscopic imaging technologies.\n",

We also noted that the graphs of $B_r(r,z)/B_0$ have local extrema at the lens opening and ending, $z_1$ and $z_2$, respectively.

    "**Figure 6.** This image shows a scatter plot of the 1000 randomly generated initial conditions for the electron beam simulation. The black circle represents the boundary of the lens. Although some points get close to this boundary, we can see that no beams that start outside of the lens are accounted for. For the full simulation, we only used 100 initial conditions. Calculating more iterations is possible but results in longer computation times."

    "**Figure 7.** Plotting the trajectories of all 100 runs reveals the lens-like behavior of the magnetic solenoid as it focuses the electron beams into a relatively small area. This occurs for all beams despite them entering the lens from different radial positions. This is a direct consequence of the magnetic field being proportional to the radial position of the electron as it enters the lens, as stated earlier. Being further away from the axis of the solenoid results in a stronger Lorentz force acting on the electrons, thus curving their path more sharply. This turns out to be just right to nearly preserve the focal point at which different beams intersect."

    "**Figure 8.** This plot shows the relationship between the minimum radial distance achieved by a beam and the focal length, i.e. the distance between the back of the solenoid and the z coordinate where that minimum is achieved. The plot confirms the observation that for beams whose focal length is shorter, the radial distance at the focal point tends to be larger. Further, this relationship seems to be quantized, as shown by the sudden jumps in the trend line of the graph. This could be an artifact of the integration process, or perhaps a result of approximating the minima with discrete data points. The most common focal length seems to be somewhere around 0.380 m."

    "In conclusion, our project successfully simulated the behavior of a magnetic lens within a scanning electron microscope (SEM), addressing both theoretical and computational aspects. Through the derivation of the radial and longitudinal components of the magnetic field, and by implementing these equations in our simulations, we were able to accurately model the magnetic lens' effect on electron trajectories. Our results demonstrated how different parameters, such as the lens length, radius, and magnetic field strength, influence the focusing properties of the lens.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The simulations, conducted under various configurations, revealed the critical role of the magnetic lens in focusing electron beams to a fine spot, essential for the high-resolution imaging capabilities of SEMs. By adjusting parameters like the solenoid's length and magnetic field strength, we could observe changes in the focal length and beam profile, providing insights into the lens' optimization for practical SEM applications.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Our project not only deepened our understanding of the physical principles governing magnetic lenses but also honed our computational skills through the application of numerical integration and visualization techniques. The collaborative effort led to a comprehensive exploration of the magnetic lens concept, offering a solid foundation for future research in SEM technology and its applications."
