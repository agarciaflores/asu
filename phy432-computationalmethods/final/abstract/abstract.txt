A Brief Overview of Quantum Computing and it's Applications

Agustin Garcia Flores, Nathan Reynolds

Quantum computers are a fascinating concept with numerous applications in research. However, because quantum information is inherently vulnerable to external perturbations, its practicality is not certain. In this research, we use IBM quantum systems to investigate quantum computing subjects such as quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. Specifically, we use the QASM Simulator for an ideal environment and the AerSimulator to produce a noisy environment similar to that of IBM Kyoto, a quantum computer. We concentrate on the four Bell states and their M qubit extensions, the GHZ states. Based on our tolerance thresholds, we discovered no success of entanglement when using the noisy environment, but near perfect results while using the QASM simulator. We achieved similar outcomes to quantum entanglement by teleporting only the computational base states in quantum teleportation. We discovered that error rate trends are solely determined by the number of qubits used, not the Bell states or teleportation state. In quantum key distribution, we discovered that the final key length is around half the original length, regardless of the environment. These findings show great potential in the field of quantum cryptography, but they also highlight the necessity for quantum error correction codes for quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation.
